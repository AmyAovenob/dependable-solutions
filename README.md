                    ******************** Brief Description ********************


I have done this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here I have added validation to the login page and after login, the welcome page including configuration, tabular-data and multi-tab page has been designed and developed as per the requirements.


Noted:-
The entire website has been researched by UX/UI and made in light of modern design. Responsive design, along with animation effects have been used which will attract the user more. The entire development has been done with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And has been done by following the standard code.


Login Page:-
The login page is organized by username, password and login button. Form validation is used here. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the welcome page.

Welcome Page:-
The welcome page is organized by a header, footer, welcome message and some details. It also has a navigation bar.

Configuration Page:-
The configuration page is organized into header, footer and theme configuration, as well as navigation bar configuration. Which allows you to easily change the theme color and navigation system of the entire website.

Tabular Data Page:-
The tabular data page is organized with a header, footer and a responsive table. The table contains some data and action buttons (view, edit, download, delete). An add new button is also used.

Multi-Tab Form Page:-
The multi-tab form page is designed with a header, footer and a tab. The tab has two sections, a form control and a nested table. The nested table has an Add New button, which, when clicked, opens a modal and this modal is designed with some form elements.


Instructions to run the project locally:-
There is a file named login.html inside the root folder. Please double-click it to open it in the browser.


Thank you.
